		\item Segment controller
			\begin{itemize}
				\item heavy lifting data structure
				\item manages a pool of segments 
				\item tracks segment utilization for efficient GC
			\end{itemize}
		\item Segment
			\begin{itemize}
				\item each segment maps its data blocks to the inodes that own them 
				\item keeps a write head that allows for constant time chunk allocation
				\item finding and garbage collecting low utilization chunks can be costly, however
			\end{itemize}
		\item Experiences with LFS
			\begin{itemize}
				\pro LFS dramatically decreased time to allocate chunks
			  \pro Faster sequential writes due to constant time chunk allocation
				\con Slower updates due to poor utilization of page cache when doing copy on write for updates
				\con Introduces costly GC operation
			\end{itemize}
